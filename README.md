This is an ongoing transcription of the entire 'The Schillinger System of
Musical Composition'

The main file is `2024-02-16.tex`.

It is an endeavor to learn the contents of the book as well
as get better at LaTeX and Lilypond.

Please feel free to fork this and continue my work, or
create a repo for a community endeavor of this project. I
will, however, be doing this on my own here for myself, and
for whoever else benefits from my experiment in learning.

I'm trying to get the bulk of the information in before I
worry about spelling and formatting errors too much, so
expect typos and some weird formatting/page breaks/etc.

I'm writing this in Neovim with a shell script rendering the
files with `lilypond-book` and `lualatex` on every save.

Enjoy!
