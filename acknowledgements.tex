\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Mrs. Joseph Schillinger wishes to acknowledge gratefully the editorial
contribution of Lyle Dowling and Arnold Shaw, co-editors of \textit{The
Schillinger System of Musical Composition}. The manuscript was
originally in the form of cor- respondence lessons. The work of editing the
manuscript was begun by Lyle Dowling, a friend of Schillinger's. Be- cause of
his induction into the armed forces, the task was continued by Arnold Shaw, who
is responsible for the bulk of the work and who saw the manuscript through the
various stages of production. It is appropriate also to note here that Arnold
Shaw, executive director of the Schillinger Society, conducted the first
lecture course---Introduction to the Schillinger System---at the Juilliard School
of Music during the summer of 1945.
